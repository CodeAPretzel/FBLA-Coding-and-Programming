<!--------------------------------- ConnectEd About ------------------------------------------->

<a name="connected-about"></a>
### ConnectEd About ðŸ“œ
Whether someone in a school's Career and Technical Education Department is trying to store business information or someone wanting to store general data, ConnectEd allows the ability for users to store, navigate, modify, and integrate data into their work or personal projects.
<br>

<!--><li></li><br>

This software application stores user's data on a secure network that can be easily retrieved by user's authentication in the form of a password and username. This allows the user to easily come back to the application and pick back up from where they left off without having to store any of this data on their local machine.

<br>
<br>

<a name="connected-inner-workings"></a>
### ConnectEd Inner Workings :gear:
This application is structured in <b>two</b> main parts. The first part is the communication between our application programming interface <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/api/#:~:text=API%20stands%20for%20Application%20Programming,other%20using%20requests%20and%20responses.">`(API)`</a> and our MongoDB server. Whenever the API receives a username and password from the user, it sends a request to the MongoDB server, validates the response, and sends feedback to the user to either accept the user into the software application or deny them.

<br>

Below is a snippet of the API's POST request to the server to validate the user's username, password, and authenticate their token for the session.

<br>

```ts
userRouter.post("/login", async (req, res) => {
  const username = req.body.username;
	const password = req.body.password;
	const user = await userModel.findOne({
		username
	}, { _id: 0, __v: 0 });

	if (user) {
		const isValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);

		if (isValid) {
			const token = generateAccessToken(user.username);
			res.status(200).json({
				token,
				user
			});
		} else {
			res.status(400).json({ error: "Invalid Password" });
		}
	}
});
```

<br>
<br>

To Further demonstrate this point, below is a simple diagram showing this process:

<br>

`User Sends Request to API    -->    API Checks and Validates from MongoDB    -->    User is Either Granted or Denied Access`
